# RFID_Attendance_System
I used arduino to scan the card using a RFID-RC522 module and store the card number in a log.txt file. 

I have uploaded the python code that reads the RFID card number from a log.txt file and updates it in the database.

I also uploaded the log.txt file and working screenshots
For the sake of understanding I have assumed card numbers to be the same as SAP-ID
